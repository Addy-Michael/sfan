              Industry analysis has shown that, on average, it takes university
              graduates in Africa six years to find their first jobs. But on the
              demand side, even when jobs are available, employers still
              struggle to find early career professionals that have the skills
              they need for such roles. SFAN brings the needed fresh
              perspectives to the scene by equipping entry-level job seekers
              with requisite job readiness skills and helping employers find the
              brightest talents across the continent. We also help entrepreneurs
              to build businesses that thrive. We do the heavy lifting, you get
              10x results without breaking the bank.

                An Insight Into The Problem
              </h4>
              <p>
                Youth unemployment was already a massive challenge for many
                African countries before Sars-Cov-2 came around. Go ahead and
                Google it. The numbers will make your brain hurt. Research by
                different organizations shows that in Africa, young people
                account for 60% of all joblessness. According to the African
                Development Bank (AfDB), about 10-12mn youth enter the African
                job market annually, but the Continent creates only 3.7mn jobs.
                Cognizant of this significant imbalance, we began piloting the
                <span>readyforwork.africa</span> program two years ago to help
                young people live on their terms and, in turn, act as catalysts
                to inspire others to unlock their potentials. Huda Ibrahim was
                among the participants in that pilot program. And in celebration
                of International Women’s Day and Ghana’s Independence, we caught
                up with her to follow up on her career journey

                </h2>
                <p>
                  My name is Huda Ibrahim, a 24-year-old lady who lives in
                  Techiman, Ghana. I joined the ReadyForWork program shortly
                  after my National Service at the EPA Head Office in Accra. The
                  aim was to gain skills that would help me excel in any career
                  path I choose. Before joining the program, I had applied to
                  some companies for an internship or full-time job, because I
                  was about to end my service and needed a job. But I didn’t get
                  a call from those applications as yet. And although I had some
                  idea of the type of job I wanted, I wasn’t sure what career
                  path to choose. So I needed guidance from the ReadyForWork
                  program to define my career path.

                  What impact did the ReadyForWork Career Coaching Program have
                  on you?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  ReadyForWork made an immense impact on me. From strategies on
                  developing critical thinking skills and other job-readiness
                  skills to starting and running a blog, it was amazing! We had
                  various sessions with trainers from Ghana and Europe. The
                  session on work-life balance with Jamila Meischke was
                  impactful, and I also had a one-on-one chat with Tracy Kyei of
                  Samsung Ghana. After the training, I started to learn more
                  about running a blog, and I applied a lot of what I learned in
                  my next job. I took a step further to read more about critical
                  thinking and creative problem solving, and I have improved
                  tremendously in those areas. Also, I have been able to upgrade
                  my resume with the knowledge gained from the training, which
                  contributed to my present job as the Assistant Program Officer
                  with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Techiman.

                <p>
                  As I mentioned earlier, I currently work as an Assistant
                  Program Officer with the Environmental Protection Agency in
                  Techiman. I started this role in the 3rd week of December 2020
                  after working with cedijob, a startup that helps businesses
                  hire freelancers, artisans, handymen, and professional service
                  workers. When I joined cedijob, they had just started —
                  without formal structures and systems, such as keeping
                  standard accounting information. Although I didn’t have any
                  accounting background, I took some online courses and used
                  that knowledge to help them create a decent accounting system.
                  I also helped them develop their content plan before the team
                  hired someone to handle that responsibility. More so, I helped
                  them develop a back office that works with non-tech-savvy
                  artisans. Overall, I’d say that I helped the team stay focused
                  on their mission within the 11 months of my work with them

                The State of Global Workplace survey by Gallup found that ONLY
                19% of Ghanaian workers that were reviewed felt engaged. A
                majority of the respondents, 68%, felt not engaged. Not engaged
                in this context, they said, is that “employees are
                psychologically unattached to their work and company. Because
                their engagement needs are not being fully met, they’re putting
                time — but not energy or passion — into their work.” Further,
                12% of surveyed employees are actively disengaged. That means,
                “employees aren’t just unhappy at work — they are resentful that
                their needs aren’t being met and are acting out their
                unhappiness. Every day, these workers potentially undermine what

                impoverished living conditions, fuels migration out of Africa.
